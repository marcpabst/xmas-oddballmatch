@Fig:fronto displays grand averages of event-related potentials (ERP) at pooled FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2 electrode locations to A tones (A-A-A-**A**-X), B tones (A-A-A-A-**B**), and their difference (**B** tone minus **A** tone) for both 100 ms (left panel) and 150 ms (right panel) SOAs. The top half of each panel shows ERPs in the *predictable condition* while the lower half depicts ERPs in the *random condition*. Clearly visible rhythms result from fast presentation frequencies and illustrate the considerable overlap between neighboring tones. Panels also show the distribution of mean amplitude differences in the MMN latency window across participants and the difference of scalp topographies. Similarly, waveforms and mean amplitude difference distributions at pooled mastoid sites are shown in @fig:mastoids.

The MMN latency window was determined to range from 108 ms to 158 ms ofter stimilus onset for 100 ms SOA and from 104 ms to 154 ms after stimulus onset for 150 ms SOA. Mean amplitudes from that interval are shown in Table 1. Descriptively, mean amplitudes at pooled frontocentral electrode locations were more negative for randomly presented B tones than for randomly presented A tones, regardless of presentation rate (100 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_100}}}; 150 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_150}}}). A simmilar observation could be made for predictable tones presented at 150 ms SOA  ({{{desc_pred_a_b_150}}}), Strikingly however, B tones presented at an SOA of 100 ms  seemed to elicit more positive responses than A tones ({{{desc_pred_a_b_100}}}). 

Statistical analysis was carried out by separate two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA, Table 2). For the 100 ms SOA presentation,  ANOVA results for the frontocentral electrode cluster revealed a significant effect of the interaction term (*condition* x *stimulus type*; {{{anova_03_100_fronto_condition_stimulustype}}}). For slower tone presentation (150 ms SOA), ANOVA results suggested a main effect of factor *stimulus type* for both frontocentral ({{{anova_03_150_fronto_stimulustype}}}) and mastoid electrodes ({{{anova_03_150_mastoids_stimulustype}}}). ANOVAs for the comparison between the 4th A tone and the 5th A tone (A-A-A-**A**-X versus A-A-A-A-**A**; Table 2) did not result in any significant effects.

Here, a significant interaction term indicated that difference waves for A and B tones differed between conditions. Two-tailed Student's *t*-tests and complementary Bayesian analysis were used to test pairwise MMN responses for significance from zero. The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg step-up procedure was used to correct p-values for multiple comparisons. Results indicated that B tones eclicted more positive responses compared to A tones when presented in a predictable context ({{{posthoc_pred_a_b_fronto_100}}}). Although descriptive statistics suggested a contrary effect for randomly presented tones, results remained inconclusive ({{{posthoc_rand_a_b_fronto_100}}}).

Average split-half reliabilities ([@Fig:rel]) demonstrate that reliability can be characterized as a function of epoch number. Whereas a high number of epochs provided reasonable reliability, particularly small samples resulted in highly unreliable estimates. This observation might serve as a plausible explanation for aforementioned inconclusive result insofar as epoch numbers for B tones ($N_{avg} = 364.4$) could be inadequately low to obtain a reliable estimate. In comparison, including all B tones (instead of only tones that were part of a five-tone pattern), on average led to an eightfold increase in epoch numbers ($N_{avg} = 2919.8$). Interestingly, statistical comparison for such an extended sample was no longer inconclusive but indicated strong evidence in favor of an effect ({{{random_alternative_contrast_100_a_b}}}).
