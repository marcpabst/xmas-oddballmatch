@Fig:fronto displays grand averages of event-related potentials (ERP) at pooled FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2 electrode locations to A tones (A-A-A-**A**-X), B tones (A-A-A-A-**B**), and their difference (**B** tone minus **A** tone) for both 100 ms (left panel) and 150 ms (right panel) SOAs. The top half of each panel shows ERPs in the *predictable condition* while the lower half depicts ERPs in the *random condition*. Clearly visible rhythms result from fast presentation frequencies and illustrate the considerable overlap between neighboring tones. Panels also show the distribution of mean amplitude differences in the MMN latency window across participants and the difference of scalp topographies. Similarly, waveforms and mean amplitude difference distributions at pooled mastoid sites are shown in @fig:mastoids.

The MMN latency window was determined to range from 108 ms to 158 ms ofter stimilus onset for 100 ms SOA and from 104 ms to 154 ms after stimulus onset for 150 ms SOA. Mean amplitudes from that interval are shown in Table 1. Descriptively, mean amplitudes at pooled frontocentral electrode locations were more negative for randomly presented B tones than for randomly presented A tones, regardless of presentation rate (100 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_100}}}; 150 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_150}}}). A simmilar observation could be made for predictable tones presented at 150 ms SOA  ({{{desc_pred_a_b_150}}}), Strikingly hoewever, when presented at 100 ms SOA, B tones seemed to elicit more positive responses than A tones ({{{desc_pred_a_b_100}}}). 

Statistical analysis was carried out using independent two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA, Table 2). For the 100 ms SOA presentation,  ANOVA results for the frontocentral electrode cluster revealed a significant effect of the interaction term (*condition* x *stimulus type*; {{{anova_03_100_fronto_condition_stimulustype}}}). For slower tone presentation ($SOA = 150 ms$ ), ANOVA results suggested a main effect of factor *stimulus type* for both frontocentral ({{{anova_03_150_fronto_stimulustype}}}) and mastoid electrodes ({{{anova_03_150_mastoids_stimulustype}}}). ANOVAs for the comparison between the 4th A tone and the 5th A tone (A-A-A-**A**-X versus A-A-A-A-**A**; Table 2) did not result in any significant effects.

Significant interactions indicate that difference waves between A and B tones differ across conditions. Two-tailed Student's *t*-tests and complementary Bayesian analysis were used to test individual MMN responses for significance from zero. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg step-up procedure. Results indicate that responses to B tones are more positive in comparisons to A tones when presented in a predictable context ({{{posthoc_pred_a_b_fronto_100}}}). Although descriptive statistics indicated a contrary effect for randomly tones presented, results remained inconclusive ({{{posthoc_rand_a_b_fronto_100}}}).

To investigate whether absence of evidence for an MMN might be due to low whin-participant sample sizes, the anaylsis was repeated for the *random* condition including not only B tone trials that occured within a five-tone sequence (as with the pregistrated analyis path), but all B tones and their immediately preceding A tone. Results from this comparison are shown in @Fig:??.

Split-half reliabilities are displayed in @fig:rel. Simulated values match the curve expected from the  Spearman-Brown formula. In the context of classcial test theory, this method relates the length of a test (or *experiment*) to the number of items (or *trials*). The first derivitve of the Spearman-Brown function is monotonically decreasing, leading to two different observation: i) Adding additional epochs (extending the test length by an absolute value in classcial test theory terms) has a large effect when the number of already present epochs is low, but has only little effect when already dealing with large numbers of epochs and ii) SOA and thus effect sized have a larger impact when epoch numbers are small compared to high epoch numbers. Graphed values also show that reliabilities for the 100 ms stimulation rate are considerably lower than for an SOA of 150 ms and that reliabilities are very low when using a relatively small number of epochs. There is no generally accepted rule as to the level above which the coefficient can be considered acceptable. Rather, reliabiliy should be evaluated based on the purpose of a study considering the cost-benefit trade-off [@nunnallyPsychometricTheory1994]. As laid out, inreased realibility comes at overproportionate cost, in that collecting more samples will not increase ralibility by the same factor. That said, many published articles deem reliability coefficients above .7 or .8 "acceptable" [@lanceSourcesFourCommonly2006].
