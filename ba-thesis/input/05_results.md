Grand averages of event-related potentials (ERP) at pooled FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2 electrode locations to A tones (A-A-A-**A**-X), B tones (A-A-A-A-**B**), and their difference (**B** tone minus **A** tone) are displayed in @fig:fronto for both 100 ms (left panel) and 150 ms (right panel) stimulus onset asynchronies. The top half of each panel shows ERPs in the *predictable condition* while the lower half depicts ERPs in the *random condition*. For both presentation rates, clear rhythms matching the presentation frequency of 10 Hz (100 ms) and respectively 6.667 Hz (150 ms) are seen as a result of substantial overlap of neighbouring tones. Panels also show the distribution of mean amplitude differences in the MMN latency window  (as defined above, 110 ms to 160 ms after stimulus onset) across participants and the difference of scalp topographies averaged over the same interval. Similarly, waveforms and mean amplitude difference distributions at pooled mastoid sites are shown in @fig:mastoids.

Evoked responses to A and B tones were compared by calculating mean amplitudes in the MMN latency window and can be seen in Table 1.  For the 100 ms SOA presentation, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) results only revealed a significant effect of the interaction term (*condition* x *stimulus type*; {{{anova_03_100_fronto_condition_stimulustype}}}) for the frontocentral electrode cluster. For slower tone presentation ($SOA = 150 ms$ ), ANOVA results suggest a main effect of factor *stimulus type* for both frontocentral ({{{anova_03_150_fronto_condition_stimulustype}}})) and mastoid electrodes ({{{anova_03_150_mastoids_condition_stimulustype}}}).

Post-hoc tests between ERPs to A and B tones were carried out using two-tailed Student's *t*-tests complemenary Bayesian analysis comparing A and B tones.  P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg step-up procedure, Bayes factors were reported in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Descriptively, mean amplitudes at pooled frontocentral electrode locations were more negative for randomly presented B tones than for randomly presented A tones, regardless of tone presentation rate (100 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_100}}}; 150 ms: {{{desc_rand_a_b_150}}}). However, inference statistical analysis indicated a significant effect only in the 150-ms condition ({{{posthoc_rand_a_b_fronto_150}}}; 100 ms: {{{posthoc_rand_a_b_fronto_100}}}). A simmilar observation could be made for predictable tones presented at 150 ms SOA  ({{{desc_pred_a_b_150}}}, {{{posthoc_pred_a_b_fronto_150}}}),  Strikingly hoewever, when presented at 100 ms SOA, B tones elicited more positive responses than A tones ({{{desc_pred_a_b_100}}}, {{{posthoc_pred_a_b_fronto_100}}}).  Significantly more positive B tones at at mastoids might indicate polarity reversal effects but were only present at 150 ms SOA for predictable ({{{posthoc_pred_a_b_mast_150}}}) tones but not for tones presented in random order ({{{posthoc_rand_a_b_mast_150}}}). No such effect could be observed in the 100 ms SOA condition for either predcitable ({{{posthoc_pred_a_b_mast_100}}}) or random presentation ({{{posthoc_rand_a_b_mast_100}}}).

To investigate whether absence of evidence for an MMN might be due to low whin-participant sample sizes, the anaylsis was repeated for the *random* condition including not only B tone trials that occured within a five-tone sequence (as with the pregistrated analyis path), but all B tones and their immediately preceding A tone. Results from this comparison are shown in @Fig:??.

Split-half reliabilities are displayed in @fig:rel. Simulated values match the curve expected from the  Spearman-Brown formula. In the context of classcial test theory, this method relates the length of a test (or *experiment*) to the number of items (or *trials*). The first derivitve of the Spearman-Brown function is monotonically decreasing, leading to two different observation: i) Adding additional epochs (extending the test length by an absolute value in classcial test theory terms) has a large effect when the number of already present epochs is low, but has only little effect when already dealing with large numbers of epochs and ii) SOA and thus effect sized have a larger impact when epoch numbers are small compared to high epoch numbers. Graphed values also show that reliabilities for the 100 ms stimulation rate are considerably lower than for an SOA of 150 ms and that reliabilities are very low when using a relatively small number of epochs. There is no generally accepted rule as to the level above which the coefficient can be considered acceptable. Rather, reliabiliy should be evaluated based on the purpose of a study considering the cost-benefit trade-off [@nunnallyPsychometricTheory1994]. As laid out, inreased realibility comes at overproportionate cost, in that collecting more samples will not increase ralibility by the same factor. That said, many published articles deem reliability coefficients above .7 or .8 "acceptable" [@lanceSourcesFourCommonly2006].
