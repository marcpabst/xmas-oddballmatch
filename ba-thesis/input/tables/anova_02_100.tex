\caption{Results of the 3-way ANOVA (condition x stimulus x electrode) for repeated measures conducted on the mean ERP-amplitudes (time window 111 - 161 ms) at electrode Fz (upper section). The significant interaction between the three factors included was further analyzed by 2-way ANOVAS (stimulus x electrode) conducted separately for the random condition (middle section) and the predictable condition (lower section).}
