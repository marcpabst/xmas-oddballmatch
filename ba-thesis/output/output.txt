Introduction
============

-- Introducing oddball paradigm -- The auditory oddball paradigm is a
well-established type of experimental design extensivly used in event
related potential (ERP) studies. In its basic form, subjects are
presented with a series of similar tones or sounds (so-called
*standards*), interrupted by rare tones or sounds that differ in at
least one feature (*deviants*) from the more frequent ones. Since it is
assumed that the brain constantly makes predictions about future sensory
impressions and deviating auditory events must violate these
predictions, these rare sounds play an important role in understanding
prediction and expectation in the human brain. Different measures have
been used to quantify differenced in processing between *standard* and
*deviant* events,\
-- introducing MMN -- One of the best-studied approaches to measure
these differences in processing is known as the missmatch negativity
(MMN) component, obtained by subtracting the reponse to deviant events
from the resposne to standard events. Negativity is strongest in the
fronto-temporal area of the scalp with a peak latency ranging from 100
to 250 ms after stimulus onset. The eliction of MMN is not restricted to
the reptition of physically identical stimuli but can also be observed
when deviant events are of complex nature, e.g. when abstract auditory
regularities are violated
[@paavilainenMismatchnegativityMMNComponent2013a]. The regularities can
come in the form of relationships between two

-- introducing sussmans study --
@sussmanPredictabilityStimulusDeviance1998 presented participants with a
sequency of frequent pure tones and rare pitch deviants. Tones were
arranged in a predictable five-tone pattern consisting of four standard
tones and one deviant (i.e. A-A-A-A-B-A-A-A-A-B, ''-'' indicating
silence between the tones). ERPs to A and B tones were compared for
rapid (SOA of 100 ms) and slow (SOA of 1200 ms) stimulation rates. For
the 100 ms SOA, they also included a control condition in which tone
order was pseudo-random (e.g. A-A-A-B-A-B-A-A-A) without altering
deviant probability ($p_B = 20\%$). MMNs were only elicted if tone
presentation was slow and predcitable or fast and random. In a subsquent
study, @sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005 used the same pattern at
different SOAs (200 ms, 400 ms, and 800 ms). Simmilarly to their prevous
study, grouped presentation at 400 ms and 800 ms SOA elicted a MMN,
while at a stimulution rate of 200 ms such evidence was absent. Sussman
et al. attributed this observation to sensory memory limitations. Only
when auditory memory accommodates enough repetitions of the five-tone
pattern, tones could be integrated into a coherent representation
allowing for accurate predictions of deviant tones (explaing the absence
of MMNs. They further argued that while this must be the case for fast
presentation rates with SOAs up to 200 ms, for longer SOAs pattern
durations would be too long ans thus eceed sensory memory capacity. The
main weakness in their study is that they ma

Methods and Materials
=====================

Data Acquisition
----------------

### Participants

#### 100 ms Presentation Rate

Twenty-three psychology undergraduate students (2 males, average age
22.6 yrs., $SD=5.57$, range 18 - 42 yrs.) were recruited at the
Institute of Psychology at the University of Leipzig. All participants
reported good general health, normal hearing and had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. Written informed consent was obtained before
the experiment. One-third (34.8%) of participants spent time enaging in
musical activities at time of survey, while 8.7% had no prior experience
in music training. Handedness was asseced using a modified version of
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
[@oldfieldAssessmentAnalysisHandedness1971, see appendix]. A majoritiy
(00%) of parcicipants favored the right hand. Particpants were blinded
in respect to the purpose of the experiment and received course credit
in compensation.

#### 150 ms Presentation Rate

Twenty healthy participants (0 males, average age 00.0 yrs., $SD=0.00$,
range 00 - 00 yrs.) were recruited. Particpants gave informed consent
and reported normal hearing and corrected or corrected-to-normal vision.
All participants were naive regarding the purpose of the experiment and
were compensated in cource credit or money. 00 participants (00%) had
received musical training in the last 5 years before the experiment
while 00 (00%) reported no musical experiance. In addition, participants
reported if streaming occured during the presentation of the tones.

### Stimuli and Stimulis Delivery

![Tones of two different frequencies (A=440 Hz, B=449 Hz) were presented
in two blocked conditions: In the "predictable" condition (top half),
tones followed a simple pattern in which a single B-tone followed four
A-tones. Some designated B-tones were replaced by A-tones ("pattern
deviants"). In the "random" condition (lower half), tones were presented
in a pseudo-random fashion ()](figures/fig_tones.pdf)

Participants where seated in a comfortable chair in a sound-insulated
cabin. The experimental setup was practically the same as the one used
ny Sussman, but instead of reading a book, subjects were asked to focus
their attention on a previously selected movie. Movies were presented
with subtitles but without sound. Commercially available software
(MATLAB R2014a; The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) in conjunction with the
Psychophysics Toolbox extension [version 3.0.12,
@brainardPsychophysicsToolbox1997; @kleinerWhatNewPsychtoolbox32007] was
used to control stimulus presentation. Stimuli consisted of pure
sinusoidal tones with a duration of 50 ms (including a 10 ms cosine
on/off ramp), presented isochronously at a stimulation onsets asynchrony
(SOA) of 100 ms for study 1 and 150 ms for study 2. Overall, a total of
40 blocks containing a mixture of frequent 440 Hz tones ("A" tones) and
infrequent 449 Hz tones ("B" tones) were delivered binaurally using
Sennheiser XY headphones. In one half of the blocks, tones were
presented in pseudo-random order (e.g. A-A-A-B-A-B-A}, "random"
condition), while in the remaining block tone presentation followed a
simple pattern in which a five-tone-sequence of four frequent tones and
one infrequent tone (i.e. A-A-A-A-B) was repeated cyclically
("predictable" condition). The ratio of frequent and infrequent tones
was 10% for both conditions. Within the predictable condition, 10% of
designated (infrequent) B tones were replaced by A tones, resulting in
sporadic five-tone sequences consisting solely of A tones
(i.e. A-A-A-A-A), thus violating the predictability rule. To assure
comparability of local histories between tones in both conditions,
randomly arranged tones were interspersed with sequences mimicking
aforementioned patterns from the predictable condition (B-A-A-A-A-B and
B-A-A-A-A-A) in the random condition. A grand total of 2000 tones in
study 1 and 4000 tones in study 2 were delivered to each participant.
The order of the runs was counterbalanced across participants.

### Data Acquisition

Electrophysiological data was recorded from active
silver-silver-chloride (*Ag*-*AgCl*) electrodes using an ActiveTwo
amplifier system (BioSemi B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Acquisition
was monitored online to ensure optimal data quality. A total of 39
channels were obtained using a 32-electrode-cap and 7 external
electrodes. Scalp electrode locations conformed to the international
10--20 system. Horizontal and vertical eye movement was obtained using
two bipolar configurations with electrodes placed around the lateral
canthi of the eyes and above and below the right eye. Additionally,
electrodes were placed on the tip of the nose and at the left and right
mastoid sites. Data was sampled at 512 Hz and on-line filtered at 1000
Hz.

Analysis Pipeline
-----------------

Data prepossessing was implemented using a custom pipeline based on the
*MNE Python* software package [@gramfortMEGEEGData2013] using *Python
3.7*. All computations were carried out on a cluster operated by the
University Computation Center of the University of Leipzig. Code used in
thesis is publicly available at
<https://github.com/marcpabst/xmas-oddballmatch>.

First, EEG data was subjected to the ZapLine procedure
[@decheveigneZapLineSimpleEffective2020] to remove line noise
contamination. A fivefold detection procedure as described by
@bigdely-shamloPREPPipelineStandardized2015 was then used to detect and
subsequently interpolate bad channels. This specifically included the
detection of channels thain contain prolonged segments with verry small
values (i.e. flat channels), the exclusion of channels based on robust
standard deviation (deviation criterion), unusualy pronounced
high-frequency noise (noisiness criterion), and the removal of channels
that were poorly predicted by nearby channels (correlation criterion and
predictability criterion). Channels considered bad by one or more of
these methods were removed and interpolated using spherical splines
[@perrinSphericalSplinesScalp1989]. Electrode locations for
interpolations were informed by the BESA Spherical Head Model.

For Independant Component Anaylsis (ICA), data 1-Hz-high-pass filtered
(134th order hamming-windowed FIR) was applied prior to ICA
[@winklerInfluenceHighpassFiltering2015]. To further reduce artifacts,
Artifact Subspace Reconstruction [ASR,
@mullenRealtimeNeuroimagingCognitive2015] was used to identify parts of
the data with unusual characteristics (bursts) which were subsequently
removed. ICA was then carried out using the *Picard* algorithm
[@ablinFasterICAOrthogonal2017; @ablinFasterIndependentComponent2018] on
PCA-whitened data. To avoid rank-deficiency when extracting components
from data with one or more interpolated channels, PCA was also used for
dimensionality reduction. The EEGLAB [version 2020.0,
@delormeEEGLABOpenSource2004] software package and the IClabel plugin
[version 1.2.6,
@pion-tonachiniICLabelAutomatedElectroencephalographic2019] were used to
automatically classify estimated components. Only components clearly
classified (i.e. confidence above 50%) as resulting from either eye
movement, muscular, or heartbeat activity were zeroed-out before
applying the mixing matrix to unfiltered data.

In line with recommendations from @widmannDigitalFilterDesign2015 and
@decheveigneFiltersWhenWhy2019, a ORDER finite impulse response (FIR)
bandpass filter from 0.1 Hz to 40 Hz (Hamming window, 0.1 Hz lower
bandwith, 4 Hz upper bandwidth, 0.0194 passband ripple, and 53 dB
stopband attenuation). Continuous data was epoched into 400 ms long
segments around stimulus onsets. Epochs included a 100 ms pre-stimulus
interval. No baseline correction was applied. Segments exeeding a
peak-to-peak voltage difference of 100 µV were removed. No data set meet
the pre-registrated exclusion criterion stated of less than 100 trials
per condition, thus data from all participants (20 for 100 ms
presentation rate and 23 for 150 ms presentation rate) was analysed.

Statistical Analysis
--------------------

### MMN

The dependent variable for analysing missmatch response was calculated
by averaging amplitudes in a time window extedning ±25 ms around the
maximum negativity obtained by subtracting the mean ERP timecourse
following the (expected) deviant event from the ERP following the
(expected) standard event. To obtain mean amplitudes, ERPs to 4th
position A tones (A-A-A-**A**-X, **boldface** indicates the tone of
interest) and B tones (A-A-A-A-**B**) were averaged seperatly for both
the *random* and the *predictable* *condition*. For the *random
condition*, only tones that were part of a sequence matching the
patterns in the *predictable* condition were included.

In accordance with the original analysis by
@sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005, mean amplitudes for
frontocentral electrodes (FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2) and the two mastoid
positions (M1 and M2) were averaged separately. Then, for both SOAs,
independant three-way repeated measures analyses of variance with
factors *condition* (factors *predcitable* and *random*), *stimulus
type* (factors *A tone* and *B tone*), *electrode locations* (levels
*fronto-central* and *mastoids*), and all possible interactions were
calculated.

It is commonly known that small SOAs \[\]

Grand averages of event-related potentials (ERP) at pooled FZ, F3, F4,
FC1, and FC2 electrode locations to A tones (A-A-A-**A**-X), B tones
(A-A-A-A-**B**), and their difference (**B** tone minus **A** tone) are
displayed in Figure X for both 100 ms (left panel) and 150 ms (right
panel) stimulus onset asynchronies. The top half of each panel shows
ERPs in the *predictable condition* while the lower half depicts ERPs in
the *random condition*. For both presentation rates, clear rhythms
matching the presentation frequency of 10 Hz (100 ms) and respectively
6.667 Hz (150 ms) are seen as a result of substantial overlap of
neighbouring tones. Panels also show the distribution of mean amplitude
differences in the MMN latency window (as defined above, 110 ms to 160
ms after stimulus onset) across participants and the difference of scalp
topographies averaged over the same interval. Similarly, waveforms and
mean amplitude difference distributions at pooled mastoid sites are
shown in Figure X.

Evoked responses to A and B tones were compared by calculating mean
amplitudes in the MMN latency window. Mean amplitudes in the MMN latency
window and their standard deviations (SD) for all conditions are shown
in Table X. Descriptively, mean amplitudes at pooled fronto-central
electrode locations were more negative for randomly presented B tones
than for randomly presented A tones, regardless of tone presentation
rate (100 ms: $\Delta M = -0.358 \: \mu V$; 150 ms:
$\Delta M = -0.555 \: \mu V$) This also held for tones presented
predictably, but for the slower of the two presentation rates only
($\Delta M = -0.582 \: \mu V$)). In contrast, when predictable tone
patterns occurred at a faster 100 ms rate, B tones elicited
descriptively more positive responses than A tones
($\Delta M = 0.383 \: \mu V$). Descriptive comparison of evoked
responses from pooled left and right mastoids revealed that
pseudo-randomly presented B tones were more positive in the MMN latency
window than A tones (100-ms-SOA: $\Delta M = 0.746 \: \mu V$,
150-ms-SOA: $\Delta M = 0.510 \: \mu V$). A similar observation could be
made for predictable B tones compared to the preceding A tones at an SOA
of 150 ms ($\Delta M = 0.399 \: \mu V$)) but not for the faster
presentation rate ($\Delta M = -0.132 \: \mu V$).

Statistical analyses provided support for these findings. For the 100 ms
stimulation rate, the three-way ANOVA yielded a significant three-way
interaction effect (*condition* x *stimulus type* x *electrode
locations*; $F(1,19) = 7.53$, $p = 0.0130$) but failed to reveal main
effects for factors *stimulus type* ($F(1,19) = 1.05$, $p = 0.3180$),
*condition* ($F(1,19) = 0.83$, $p = 0.3730$), and *electrode locations*
($F(1,19) = 0.04$, $p = 0.8520$). In contrast, for tones presented at a
SOA of 150 ms only the two-way interaction term *stimulus type* x
*electrode locations* had a significant effect ($F(1,22) = 20.76$,
$p = 0.0002$). Mean amplitudes in the MMN latency window however did not
differ for factors *stimulus type* ($F(1,22) = 0.32$, $p = 0.5790$),
*electrode locations* () or *condition* ($F(1,22) = 0.95$,
$p = 0.3410$).

Two-way ANOVAs (*condition* x *stimulus type*) were carried out
separately for pooled fronto-central and mastoid electrode locations.
For 100 ms tone presentation rate, the *condition* x *stimulus type*
interaction only resulted in a significant effect for the fronto-central
electrode cluster ($F(1,19) = 16.75$, $p = 0.0006$) but not for pooled
mastoid sites ($F(1,19) = 2.37$, $p = 0.1410$) indicating that the
three-way interaction effect *condition* x *stimulus type* x *electrode*
is indeed driven by the amplitude differences in the fronto-central
electrode locations . Contrary to this, for the 150 ms presentation
rate, main effects for *stimulus type* were significant for both
fronto-central and mastoid sites, suggesting that there was both an MMN
at fronto-central locations as well as a polarity-reversal at the
mastoid electrodes.

\input{tables/anova_03_full.tex}
```
Post-hoc tests between ERPs to A and B tones were carried out using
paired Student's t-Tests. P-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons using the Benjamini--Hochberg step-up procedure. For the 100
ms SOA, results indicated a significant effect only for predictable
tones at fronto-central electrodes ($t(19) = -2.77$, $p = .025$,
$d = -0.62$). For the 150 ms SOA, B tones elicited significantly more
negative ERPs than B tones at fronto-central electrode locations in both
predictable ($t(22) = 5.20$, $p < .001$, $d = 1.08$) and random
($t(22) = 3.28$, $p = .009$, $d = 0.68$) conditions. Significant
polarity reversal effects at mastoid sites were only present for
predictable ($t(22) = -3.95$, $p = .003$, $d = -0.82$) tones but not for
randomly presented ($t(22) = -1.59$, $p = .169$, $d = -0.33$) tones.
