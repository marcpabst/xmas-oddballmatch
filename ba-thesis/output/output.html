<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Unraveling the mysteries of human perception might be one of the most fascinating and difficult challenges in cognitive sciences. We usually have little regard for this, but at every single moment, we achieve something outstanding: By forming a coherent representation from the tangled mess of external stimuli that reach our sensory organs, we make sense of the outside world. In doing so and seemingly effortlessly, we overcome complicated mathematical and philosophical problems. Recent advances in emerging fields like computer vision and machine hearing have provided a sense of how daunting these tasks can be - requiring complex models that consume vast amounts of computational resources and energy. What enables the brain to fulfill these functions with such ease while consuming no more than the power equivalent of a lightbulb?</p>
<p>Overy the centuries, many theories have been broad forward in an attempt to answer these questions. While early philosophers like Aristotle believed in the idea of direct or naïve realism (the idea that the outside world is perceived directly), early modern scholars like John Locke promoted the concept of indirect realism which is highly compatible with the assumption of representationalism in cognitive science (perceptual experiences result from an internal representation rather than directy from outside objects). Among the first who developed a consistent theory defining the rules followed by indirect perception were the Gestalt psychologist of the early 20th century. Wertheimer, Koffka, and Kühler hypothesized that Gestalt principles, self-organizing rules on how individual elements should be grouped or separated, guide perception. They based their principle on the observation that humans perceive a global whole instead of just collections of individual parts.</p>
<p>Much later, auditory scientists faced the same challenges described in the first paragraph, but now in a very particular context: They were puzzled by the brain’s ability to convert small fluctuations in air pressure into actual auditory percepts. Somehow, the brain is forming meaningful perceptual experiences from what can only be described as a busy mess of sound waves that originate from a plethora of different sources differing in pitch, loudness, and spatial position. Known as the <em>cocktail party effect</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cherryExperimentsRecognitionSpeech1953">(Cherry, 1953)</span>, this problem was compared to inferring the positions, shapes, and movements of motorboats on a lake - just by observing how two nearby objects move up and down on the waves. Attempts to find answers to this perplexing question lead to the development of auditory scene analysis (ASA). Not unlike the concepts proposed by the Gestalt theorists six decades earlier, <span class="citation" data-cites="bregman1990auditory">(Bregman, 1990)</span> suggested that the brain uses so-called <em>streaming</em> and <em>segregation</em> to form auditory objects from rich spectro-temporal information. At its core, ASA relies on two different categories of grouping, namely <em>sequential</em> and <em>simultaneous</em> integration: Simultaneous integration (or vertical integration) refers to the grouping of concurrent properties into one or more separable auditory objects, a process informed by temporal cues like common onset and offset, spectral and spatial characteristics. Sequential integration (or horizontal integration), on the other hand, describes how temporally distinct sounds are merged into one or multiple coherently perceived streams (contrary to auditory objects in simultaneous grouping, only one such stream can be actively perceived at any time). While vertical and horizontal grouping can come to different and therefore competing results, sequential grouping often takes precedence over cues for simulations integration <span class="citation" data-cites="bendixenPredictabilityEffectsAuditory2014">(Bendixen, 2014)</span></p>
<p>As is so often the case, the key to understanding such complex phenomena seems to lie in learning about the most basic processing steps. In auditory research, these steps usually come in the shape of very simple stimuli, often consisting of nothing more than pure tones. Such stimuli were also the first to be used in the auditory oddball paradigm, a now well-established and robust paradigm extensively used in event-related potential (ERP) studies <span class="citation" data-cites="squiresTwoVarietiesLonglatency1975">(Squires et al., 1975)</span>. In its basic form, participants are presented with a series of similar tones or sounds (so-called <em>standard</em> events), interrupted by rare tones or sounds that differ in at least one feature (<em>deviant</em> events) from the more frequent ones. Strikingly, deviant events elicit more extensive neural activity over sensory areas. This finding that is known as the mismatch negativity (MMN) component because when measured using EEG, a robust negative deflection can be observed in the difference wave obtained by subtracting the response to deviant events from the response to standard events. Negativity is strongest in the frontotemporal area of the scalp, with a peak latency ranging from 100 to 250 ms after stimulus onset. The elicitation of an MMN is not restricted to the repetition of physically identical stimuli but can also be observed when deviant events are complex, e.g., when abstract auditory regularities are violated <span class="citation" data-cites="paavilainenMismatchnegativityMMNComponent2013">(Paavilainen, 2013)</span>. The regularities can come in the form of relationships between two <span class="citation" data-cites="saarinenRepresentationAbstractAttributes1992">(Saarinen et al., 1992)</span> or multiple tones <span class="citation" data-cites="nordbyEventRelatedPotentialsBreaks1988 schrogerPreattentivePeriodicityDetection1996 alainBrainIndicesAutomatic1994">(Alain et al., 1994; Nordby et al., 1988; Schröger et al., 1996)</span>. Interestingly, this finding is also highly compatible with another prevalent theory of perception, namely the idea that perception is not (only) a stimulus-driven bottom-up process, but is informed by internal predicitons of some kind. These kinds of ideas have been around a long time and famously trace back to the physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz but were also proposed by numerous other figures such as Richard Gregory. In its most recent iteration, this theory has been known as (hierarchical) predictive coding. Predictive coding specifically suggests that at every processing state, predicitons from so-called <em>probabilistic generative models</em> and sensory input are constanly compared and only their difference, called the <em>prediciton error</em>, is propagated. MMN responses have been proposed as an index of prediction error <span class="citation" data-cites="wacongneEvidenceHierarchyPredictions2011">(Wacongne et al., 2011)</span>. Although other interpetations exist <span class="citation" data-cites="mayMismatchNegativityMMN2010">(May &amp; Tiitinen, 2010)</span>, MMNs are frequently intepreted as markers of expectation violations stressing the role predicitons play in perception <span class="citation" data-cites="winklerInterpretingMismatchNegativity2007">(e.g., István Winkler, 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting situation arises when concurrent predictive clues exist. Following this idea, <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanPredictabilityStimulusDeviance1998">E. Sussman et al. (1998)</span> presented participants with a sequence of frequent pure tones and rare pitch deviants while reading a book of their choice. Tones were arranged in a predictable five-tone pattern consisting of four standard tones and one deviant (i.e., A-A-A-A-B-A-A-A-A-B, ’‘-’’ indicating silence between the tones). ERPs to A and B tones were compared for rapid (SOA of 100 ms) and slow (SOA of 1200 ms) stimulation rates. The 100 ms SOA condition also included a control condition in which tone order was pseudo-randomized (e.g., A-A-A-B-A-B-A-A-A) without altering deviant probability (<span class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> = 20%</span>). When tones are presented randomly, only their relative frequency of occurrence carries value for predicting the pitch of the next tone. This, we refer to as <em>proportional regularity</em>. However, in an ordered presentation, a sequence of four standard tones is always followed by one deviant tone. Thus, understanding this relationship should allow for <em>perfect prediction</em> in which all deviant tones are expected with near-absolute certainty. We call this regularity a <em>pattern regularity</em>. Provided the underlying mechanism can incorporate such information, the processing of the pitch deviants should correspond with that of standard tones, and therefore no MMN would be elicited. Interestingly, in the case of Sussman et al., MMNs were only elicited if tone presentation was slow and predictable or fast and random, but not when predictable tones were presented in a rapid fashion. In a subsequent study, <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk (2005)</span> used the same pattern at different SOAs (200 ms, 400 ms, and 800 ms). Similar to their previous study, ordered presentation at 400 ms and 800 ms SOA elicited an MMN response, while at a stimulation rate of 200 ms, evidence for such a deflection was absent. Sussman et al. attributed this observation to sensory memory limitations. That is, only when auditory memory can accommodate enough repetitions of the five-tone pattern; the brain can integrate tones into a coherent representation allowing for accurate predictions of deviant tones. This, in turn, would explain the absence of MMNs in the fast presentation condition. Based on this, they argued that while true for fast presentation rates with SOAs up to 200 ms, for longer SOAs, pattern durations would be too long, and thus representations would exceed sensory memory capacity.</p>
<p>In a recent in-class replication study, <span class="citation" data-cites="scharfPredictableChangesFastpacedinprep">Scharf &amp; Müller (in prep)</span> presented participants with the same stimuli as Sussmann in a very similar experimental setting. Their study only differed in that participants were given a simple task in which they had to count visual targets instead of reading a book of their choice. Surprisingly, while descriptive results were compatible with those of Sussmann et al., pairwise comparisons revealed no significant effect when comparing deviant and standard tones for both the <em>random</em> and the <em>predictable</em> condition. Further Bayesian analysis remained largely inconclusive, providing only <em>anecdotal</em> evidence in favor of such an effect for <em>random</em> presentation and <em>moderate</em> evidence for its absence in the <em>predictable</em> condition. In the face of the replication crisis, many scientists have become painfully aware of the importance of replicability <span class="citation" data-cites="ioannidisWhyMostPublished2005">(Ioannidis, 2005)</span>. Exact or quasi-exact replication studies that try to match the original study’s experimental conditions as closely as possible are regarded as the gold standard of science <span class="citation" data-cites="popperLogikForschungZur1935 jasnyAgainAgainAgain2011">(Jasny et al., 2011; Popper, 1935)</span>. However, replications that extend, change, or optimize materials or methods of the original work also offer valuable insight. This kind of replications are known as conceptual <span class="citation" data-cites="schmidtShallWeReally2009">(Schmidt, 2009)</span> and refers to the use of different methods to repeat the test of a hypothesis or experimental result.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-hypothesises">Design and Hypothesises</h2>
<p>This thesis soughs to replicate the findings by Sussman et al. It largly follows the procure layed out by <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk (2005)</span> though it deviates from the original design in some important aspects First, afforementioned five-tone patterns are not only presented in the <em>preictable</em> condition, but also in the <em>random</em> context. That is, pseudo-random order will be deberatly broken by occasionally presenting B-A-A-A-A-B-patterns. In particular, this will make sure that the local history of B-tones in the <em>random</em> condition is comparable to that in the <em>predictable</em> condition. Secondly, B tones are compared exclusively with their preceding A tones. And lastly, a small number of A-A-A-A-B will be replaced by A-A-A-A-A sequences in both conditions aloowing the comparison of physically identical tones in different contexts. The advantages of this design are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs. A pre-registration coverng data collection, processing, and anaylis is avaible at https://osf.io/cg2zd/. Deviations from this pre-specified plan and further, exploratory analysisi will be clearly marked.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk (2005)</span> intepretation of the original results would suggests that at fast stimultion rates, pattern-based regulairites take precedence over proportion-based regularites. If this is indeed the case, B-tones in the <em>predictable</em> condtiion should not be considered a <em>missmatch</em> and thus should not elict an MMN. In contrast, since there is no way to reliably predict B-tones in the <em>random</em> condition, these tones would be still considered as <em>deviant</em> events and are therefore expcected to generate a MMN. On the other hand, when a predictable B tone is replced by an A tone, one would expect an MMN altough tones are physically identical. Specifically, hypotheses are formulated in regars to the ERPs elicted by the 5th tone in the five-tone sequence (A-A-A-A-<strong>B</strong> or A-A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>) compared to the 4th tone in that sequence (A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>-X, “X” marking either an A or an B tone).</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>if Sussman’s interpeatation is indeed correct</strong>, one expects i) negativity in the N1/MMN time domain (about 100-200 ms after the beginning of the tone) for deviations in the BAAAA<em>B</em> sequence in the <em>random</em> condition, since B tones violate the <em>proportioanl regularity</em>, ii) one expects no evidence for such an effect (or evidence favoring <span class="math inline">ℋ<sub>0</sub></span> i.e. that there is no effect) in the <em>predictable</em> context since more informative higher-order predictions based on <em>pattern regularity</em> are not violated, and iii) the difference waves should differ significantly. <strong>If however no <em>pattern regularity</em> is extracted</strong>, B-tones should concotenly exlivt an MMN regardless of presentation context since the predictive value of the <em>proportional regularity</em> does not differ between conditions. In that case, difference waves should not differ. As a third possiblity, <strong>the brain might use <em>proportional regularities</em> and <em>pattern regularities</em> concurently</strong>, resulting in a negativity following B-tones in either condition. To further differentiate between these explainations, we also expect the comparison of 5th A tones to peceedin A tones (A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>-X vs. A-A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>) to elict a significant MMN for options i and iii, but not for option ii.</p>

<p>Twenty-three psychology undergraduate students (2 males, average age 22.6 yrs., <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><em>D</em> = 5.57</span>, range 18 - 42 yrs.) were recruited at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Leipzig. All participants reported good general health, normal hearing and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Written informed consent was obtained before the experiment. One-third (34.8%) of participants spent time enaging in musical activities at time of survey, while 8.7% had no prior experience in music training. Handedness was asseced using a modified version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory <span class="citation" data-cites="oldfieldAssessmentAnalysisHandedness1971">(Oldfield, 1971, see appendix)</span>. A majoritiy (00%) of parcicipants favored the right hand. Particpants were blinded in respect to the purpose of the experiment and received course credit in compensation.</p>

<embed src="figures/fig_tones.pdf" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tones of two different frequencies (A=440 Hz, B=449 Hz) were presented in two blocked conditions: In the “predictable” condition (top half), tones followed a simple pattern in which a single B-tone followed four A-tones.

<p>Participants where seated in a comfortable chair in a sound-insulated cabin. The experimental setup was practically the same as the one used ny Sussman, but instead of reading a book, subjects were asked to focus their attention on a previously selected movie. Movies were presented with subtitles but without sound. Commercially available software (MATLAB R2014a; The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) in conjunction with the Psychophysics Toolbox extension <span class="citation" data-cites="brainardPsychophysicsToolbox1997 kleinerWhatNewPsychtoolbox32007">(version 3.0.12, Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al., 2007)</span> was used to control stimulus presentation. Stimuli consisted of pure sinusoidal tones with a duration of 50 ms (including a 10 ms cosine on/off ramp), presented isochronously at a stimulation onsets asynchrony (SOA) of 100 ms for study 1 and 150 ms for study 2. Overall, a total of 40 blocks containing a mixture of frequent 440 Hz tones (“A” tones) and infrequent 449 Hz tones (“B” tones) were delivered binaurally using Sennheiser HD-25-1 II headphones. In one half of the blocks, tones were presented in pseudo-random order (e.g. A-A-A-B-A-B-A}, “random” condition), while in the remaining block tone presentation followed a simple pattern in which a five-tone-sequence of four frequent tones and one infrequent tone (i.e. A-A-A-A-B) was repeated cyclically (“predictable” condition). Block order was counterbalanced accross participants. The ratio of frequent and infrequent tones was 10% for both conditions. Within the predictable condition, 10% of designated (infrequent) B tones were replaced by A tones, resulting in sporadic five-tone sequences consisting solely of A tones (i.e. A-A-A-A-A), thus violating the predictability rule. To assure comparability of local histories between tones in both conditions, randomly arranged tones were interspersed with sequences mimicking aforementioned patterns from the predictable condition (B-A-A-A-A-B and B-A-A-A-A-A) in the random condition. A grand total of 2000 tones in study 1 and 4000 tones in study 2 were delivered to each participant.</p>
<h3 id="data-acquisition-1">Data Acquisition</h3>
<p>Electrophysiological data was recorded from active silver-silver-chloride (<em>Ag</em>-<em>AgCl</em>) electrodes using an ActiveTwo amplifier system (BioSemi B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Acquisition was monitored online to ensure optimal data quality. A total of 39 channels were obtained using a 32-electrode-cap and 7 external electrodes. Scalp electrode locations conformed to the international 10–20 system. Horizontal and vertical eye movement was obtained using two bipolar configurations with electrodes placed around the lateral canthi of the eyes and above and below the right eye. Additionally, electrodes were placed on the tip of the nose and at the left and right mastoid sites. Data was sampled at 512 Hz and on-line filtered at 1000 Hz.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-pipeline">Analysis Pipeline</h2>
<p>Data prepossessing was implemented using a custom pipeline based on the <em>MNE Python</em> software package <span class="citation" data-cites="gramfortMEGEEGData2013">(Gramfort, 2013)</span> using <em>Python 3.7</em>. All computations were carried out on a cluster operated by the University Computation Center of the University of Leipzig. Code used in thesis is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/marcpabst/xmas-oddballmatch" class="uri">https://github.com/marcpabst/xmas-oddballmatch</a>.</p>
<p>First, EEG data was subjected to the ZapLine procedure <span class="citation" data-cites="decheveigneZapLineSimpleEffective2020">(de Cheveigné, 2020)</span> to remove line noise contamination. A fivefold detection procedure as described by <span class="citation" data-cites="bigdely-shamloPREPPipelineStandardized2015">Bigdely-Shamlo et al. (2015)</span> was then used to detect and subsequently interpolate bad channels. This specifically included the detection of channels thain contain prolonged segments with verry small values (i.e. flat channels), the exclusion of channels based on robust standard deviation (deviation criterion), unusualy pronounced high-frequency noise (noisiness criterion), and the removal of channels that were poorly predicted by nearby channels (correlation criterion and predictability criterion). Channels considered bad by one or more of these methods were removed and interpolated using spherical splines <span class="citation" data-cites="perrinSphericalSplinesScalp1989">(Perrin et al., 1989)</span>. Electrode locations for interpolations were informed by the BESA Spherical Head Model.</p>
<p>For independant component anaylsis (ICA), a 1-Hz-high-pass filter (134th order hamming-windowed FIR) was applied prior to ICA <span class="citation" data-cites="winklerInfluenceHighpassFiltering2015">(Irene Winkler et al., 2015)</span>. To further reduce artifacts, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction <span class="citation" data-cites="mullenRealtimeNeuroimagingCognitive2015">(ASR, Mullen et al., 2015)</span> was used to identify and remove parts of the data with unusual characteristics (bursts). ICA was then carried out using the <em>Picard</em> algorithm <span class="citation" data-cites="ablinFasterICAOrthogonal2017 ablinFasterIndependentComponent2018">(Ablin et al., 2018, 2017)</span> on PCA-whitened data. To avoid rank-deficiency when extracting components from data with one or more interpolated channels, PCA was also used for dimensionality reduction. The EEGLAB <span class="citation" data-cites="delormeEEGLABOpenSource2004">(version 2020.0, Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004)</span> software package and the IClabel plugin <span class="citation" data-cites="pion-tonachiniICLabelAutomatedElectroencephalographic2019">(version 1.2.6, Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019)</span> were used to automatically classify estimated components. Only components clearly classified (i.e. confidence above 50%) as resulting from either eye movement, muscular, or heartbeat activity were zeroed-out before applying the mixing matrix to unfiltered data.</p>
<p>In line with recommendations from <span class="citation" data-cites="widmannDigitalFilterDesign2015">Widmann et al. (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="decheveigneFiltersWhenWhy2019">de Cheveigné &amp; Nelken (2019)</span>, a ORDER finite impulse response (FIR) bandpass filter from 0.1 Hz to 40 Hz (Hamming window, 0.1 Hz lower bandwith, 4 Hz upper bandwidth, 0.0194 passband ripple, and 53 dB stopband attenuation). Continuous data was epoched into 400 ms long segments around stimulus onsets. Epochs included a 100 ms pre-stimulus interval. No baseline correction was applied. Segments exeeding a peak-to-peak voltage difference of 100 µV were removed. On average, NN epochs No data set meet the pre-registrated exclusion criterion stated of less than 100 trials per condition, thus data from all participants (20 for 100 ms presentation rate and 23 for 150 ms presentation rate) was analysed.</p>
<h2 id="statistical-analysis">Statistical Analysis</h2>
<p>Statistical Analyis was carried out using the R programming language (version 3.2). Dependent variables quantifying missmatch negativity response were calculated by averaging amplitudes in a time window strechting ±25 ms around the maximum negativity obtained by subtracting the mean ERP timecourse following the A tones from the mean ERP following B tones. To compute mean amplitudes, ERPs to 4th position A tones (A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>-X, <strong>boldface</strong> indicates the tone of interest) and B tones (A-A-A-A-<strong>B</strong>) were averaged seperatly for both the <em>random</em> and the <em>predictable</em> <em>condition</em>. For the <em>random condition</em>, only tones that were part of a sequence matching the patterns in the <em>predictable</em> condition were included.</p>
<p>In accordance with the original analysis by <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk (2005)</span>, mean amplitudes for frontocentral electrodes (FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2) and the two mastoid positions (M1 and M2) were averaged separately. Then, for both SOAs, independant three-way repeated measures analyses of variance with factors <em>condition</em> (factors <em>predcitable</em> and <em>random</em>), <em>stimulus type</em> (factors <em>A tone</em> and <em>B tone</em>), <em>electrode locations</em> (levels <em>fronto-central</em> and <em>mastoids</em>), and all possible interactions were calculated. Following this, significant interactions effects were further investigated using post-hoc <em>t</em>-tests.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that p-values are frequently misinterpreted <span class="citation" data-cites="hubbardWidespreadMisinterpretationPvalues2011">(Hubbard, 2011)</span>, traditional null hypothesis testing fails to explicitly quantify evidence in favor of <span class="math inline">ℋ<sub>0</sub></span> <span class="citation" data-cites="aczelQuantifyingSupportNull2018 meehlTheoreticalRisksTabular1978 kirkPracticalSignificanceConcept1996 goodmanDirtyDozenTwelve2008">(e.g. Aczel et al., 2018; Goodman, 2008; Kirk, 1996; Meehl, 1978)</span>.

Here, this approach was applied in agreement with the concept described by <span class="citation" data-cites="rouderBayesianTestsAccepting2009">Rouder et al. (2009)</span> as an alternative to classical frequentist paired <em>t</em>-tests. Folowing this notion, Bayes factors for within-participant differences <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> were computed assuming <span class="math inline">ℋ<sub>0</sub> : <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> ∼ <em>N</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(0, <em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>)</span> and <span class="math inline">ℋ<sub>1</sub> : <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> ∼ <em>N</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>δ</em>, <em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>; <span class="math inline">$\delta \sim Cauchy(0, 1/\sqrt{2})$</span>.

<p>Finally, the relationship between epoch number and the reliability analysis was analyzed by drawing random subsamples of different sizes from both our data sets and calculating split-half reliability employing the Spearman-Brown approach. For this, single trial responses for all A and B tones in the predictable condition were randomly shuffled. Then, <span class="math inline">100, 200, ..., <em>N</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em></sub></span> (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em>, 100<em>m</em><em>s</em></sub> = 3000, <em>N</em><sub><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em>, 150<em>m</em><em>s</em></sub> = 1500</span>) epoches were drawn, randomly assigned to one of two halfes, and afterwards averaged seperatly for bothtone types.

<p>Grand averages of event-related potentials (ERP) at pooled FZ, F3, F4, FC1, and FC2 electrode locations to A tones (A-A-A-<strong>A</strong>-X), B tones (A-A-A-A-<strong>B</strong>), and their difference (<strong>B</strong> tone minus <strong>A</strong> tone) are displayed in fig. 1 for both 100 ms (left panel) and 150 ms (right panel) stimulus onset asynchronies. The top half of each panel shows ERPs in the <em>predictable condition</em> while the lower half depicts ERPs in the <em>random condition</em>. For both presentation rates, clear rhythms matching the presentation frequency of 10 Hz (100 ms) and respectively 6.667 Hz (150 ms) are seen as a result of substantial overlap of neighbouring tones. Panels also show the distribution of mean amplitude differences in the MMN latency window (as defined above, 110 ms to 160 ms after stimulus onset) across participants and the difference of scalp topographies averaged over the same interval. Similarly, waveforms and mean amplitude difference distributions at pooled mastoid sites are shown in fig. 2.</p>

<p>Evoked responses to A and B tones were compared by calculating mean amplitudes in the MMN latency window and can be seen in Table 1. For the 100 ms SOA presentation, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) results only revealed a significant effect of the interaction term (<em>condition</em> x <em>stimulus type</em>; <span class="math inline"><em>F</em>(1, 19) = 16.75</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 0.0006</span>) for the frontocentral electrode cluster. For slower tone presentation (<span class="math inline"><em>S</em><em>O</em><em>A</em> = 150<em>m</em><em>s</em></span> ), ANOVA results suggest a main effect of factor <em>stimulus type</em> for both frontocentral (<span class="math inline"><em>F</em>(1, 22) = 0.03</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 0.8680</span>)) and mastoid electrodes (<span class="math inline"><em>F</em>(1, 22) = 0.12</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 0.7300</span>).</p>
<p>Post-hoc tests between ERPs to A and B tones were carried out using two-tailed Student’s <em>t</em>-tests complemenary Bayesian analysis comparing A and B tones. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg step-up procedure, Bayes factors were reported in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Descriptively, mean amplitudes at pooled frontocentral electrode locations were more negative for randomly presented B tones than for randomly presented A tones, regardless of tone presentation rate (100 ms: <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>M</em> =  − 0.358 <em>μ</em><em>V</em></span>; 150 ms: <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>M</em> =  − 0.555 <em>μ</em><em>V</em></span>). However, inference statistical analysis indicated a significant effect only in the 150-ms condition (<span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(22) = 3.28</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = .009</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [0.20, 0.91]</span>; 100 ms: <span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(19) = 1.64</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = .169</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [ − 0.10, 0.81]</span>). A simmilar observation could be made for predictable tones presented at 150 ms SOA (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>M</em> =  − 0.582 <em>μ</em><em>V</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(22) = 5.20</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> &lt; .001</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [0.35, 0.81]</span>), Strikingly hoewever, when presented at 100 ms SOA, B tones elicited more positive responses than A tones (<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>M</em> = 0.383 <em>μ</em><em>V</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(19) =  − 2.77</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = .025</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [ − 0.67,  − 0.09]</span>). Significantly more positive B tones at at mastoids might indicate polarity reversal effects but were only present at 150 ms SOA for predictable (<span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(22) =  − 3.95</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = .003</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [ − 0.61,  − 0.19]</span>) tones but not for tones presented in random order (<span class="math inline"><em>t</em>(22) =  − 1.59</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = .169</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><em>I</em><sub>.95</sub> = [ − 1.18, 0.16]</span>).

<p>To investigate whether absence of evidence for an MMN might be due to low whin-participant sample sizes, the anaylsis was repeated for the <em>random</em> condition including not only B tone trials that occured within a five-tone sequence (as with the pregistrated analyis path), but all B tones and their immediately preceding A tone.

<p>Split-half reliabilities are displayed in fig. 4. Simulated values match the curve expected from the Spearman-Brown formula. In the context of classcial test theory, this method relates the length of a test (or <em>experiment</em>) to the number of items (or <em>trials</em>). The first derivitve of the Spearman-Brown function is monotonically decreasing, leading to two different observation: i) Adding additional epochs (extending the test length by an absolute value in classcial test theory terms) has a large effect when the number of already present epochs is low, but has only little effect when already dealing with large numbers of epochs and ii) SOA and thus effect sized have a larger impact when epoch numbers are small compared to high epoch numbers. Graphed values also show that reliabilities for the 100 ms stimulation rate are considerably lower than for an SOA of 150 ms and that reliabilities are very low when using a relatively small number of epochs. There is no generally accepted rule as to the level above which the coefficient can be considered acceptable. Rather, reliabiliy should be evaluated based on the purpose of a study considering the cost-benefit trade-off <span class="citation" data-cites="nunnallyPsychometricTheory1994">(Nunnally et al., 1994)</span>. As laid out, inreased realibility comes at overproportionate cost, in that collecting more samples will not increase ralibility by the same factor. That said, many published articles deem reliability coefficients above .7 or .8 “acceptable” <span class="citation" data-cites="lanceSourcesFourCommonly2006">(Lance et al., 2006)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>For the 150 presentation, extreme evidence for an MMN and very strong evidence for an accopying polarity reversal at the mastoids was found in the <em>predcitable</em> condition, that is, when tones were presented in a repeated five-tone pattern. When tones were presented in random order, strong evidence was foun[[anova_02_100_posthoc]] anova_02_100_posthoc.texd for an MMN but Bayes factors suggested inconclusive evidence for mastoids. In light of the resuts by <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk (2005)</span>, we would</p>
<p>We found strong evidence for an MMN in the 150 ms delivery rate condition when comparing standards and deviants, regardless of the type of presentation (predictable vs. random). This finding is incompatible with the results and intepretation by <span class="citation" data-cites="sussmanOrganizationSequentialSounds2005">(E. S. Sussman &amp; Gumenyuk, 2005)</span> but suggests that <em>pattern regularities</em> do not inform prediction. Furthermore, no convincing evidence for an MMN was found when comparing the 4th standard to the 5th standard in predictable condition.</p>
<p>For the 150 ms , significant MMN componets were found regardless of presentation</p>
