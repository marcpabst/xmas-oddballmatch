     Good labels are critical for making your plots accessible to a
     wider audience. Always ensure the axis and legend labels display
     the full variable name. Use the plot ‘title’ and ‘subtitle’ to
     explain the main findings. It's common to use the ‘caption’ to
     provide information about the data source. ‘tag’ can be used for
     adding identification tags to differentiate between multiple
     plots.

     ...: A list of new name-value pairs. The name should be an
          aesthetic.

   title: The text for the title.

subtitle: The text for the subtitle for the plot which will be
          displayed below the title.

 caption: The text for the caption which will be displayed in the
          bottom-right of the plot by default.

     tag: The text for the tag label which will be displayed at the
          top-left of the plot by default.

   label: The title of the respective axis (for ‘xlab()’ or ‘ylab()’)
          or of the plot (for ‘ggtitle()’).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     You can also set axis and legend labels in the individual scales
     (using the first argument, the ‘name’). If you're changing other
     scale options, this is recommended.

     If a plot already has a title, subtitle, caption, etc., and you
     want to remove it, you can do so by setting the respective
     argument to ‘NULL’. For example, if plot ‘p’ has a subtitle, then
     ‘p + labs(subtitle = NULL)’ will remove the subtitle from the
     plot.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, colour = cyl)) + geom_point()
     p + labs(colour = "Cylinders")
     p + labs(x = "New x label")
     
     # The plot title appears at the top-left, with the subtitle
     # display in smaller text underneath it
     p + labs(title = "New plot title")
     p + labs(title = "New plot title", subtitle = "A subtitle")
     
     # The caption appears in the bottom-right, and is often used for
     # sources, notes or copyright
     p + labs(caption = "(based on data from ...)")
     
     # The plot tag appears at the top-left, and is typically used
     # for labelling a subplot with a letter.
     p + labs(title = "title", tag = "A")
     
     # If you want to remove a label, set it to NULL.
     p + labs(title = "title") + labs(title = NULL)
